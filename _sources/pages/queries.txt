Search query language
=====================

Syntax
^^^^^^

The search syntax is very close to the Lucene syntax. By default all message fields are included in the search if you don't specify a message
field to search in.

Messages that include the term *ssh*::

  ssh

Messages that include the term *ssh* or *login*::

  ssh login

Messages that include the exact phrase *ssh login*::

  "ssh login"

Messages where the field *type* includes *ssh*::

  type:ssh

Messages where the field *type* includes *ssh* or *login*::

  type:(ssh login)

Messages where the field *type* includes the exact phrase *ssh login*::

  type:"ssh login"

Messages that do not have the field *type*::

  _missing_:type

Messages that have the field *type*::

  _exists_:type

By default all terms or phrases are OR connected so all messages that have at least one hit are returned. You can use
**Boolean operators and groups** for control over this::

  "ssh login" AND source:example.org
  ("ssh login" AND (source:example.org OR source:another.example.org)) OR _exists_:always_find_me

You can also use the NOT operator::

  "ssh login" AND NOT source:example.org
  NOT example.org

**Note that AND, OR, and NOT are case sensitive and must be typed in all upper-case.

**Wildcards:** Use `?` to replace a single character or `*` to replace zero or more characters::

  source:*.org
  source:exam?le.org
  source:exam?le.*

**Note that leading wildcards are disabled to avoid excessive memory consumption!** You can enable them in
your ``graylog-server.conf``: ``allow_leading_wildcard_searches = true``

Also note that `message`, `full_message`, and `source` are the only fields that can be searched via wildcard by default.

**Fuzziness:** You can search for similar but not equal terms::

  ssh logni~
  source:exmaple.org~

This is using the `Damerauâ€“Levenshtein distance <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerau-Levenshtein_distance>`_ with a default
distance of *2*. You can change the distance like this::

  source:exmaple.org~1

You can also use the fuzzyness operator to do a **proximity** search where the terms in a phrase can have different/fuzzy
distances from each other and don't have to be in the defined order::

  "foo bar"~5

Numeric fields support **range queries**. Ranges in square brackets are inclusive, curly brackets are exclusive and can
even be combined::

  http_response_code:[500 TO 504]
  http_response_code:{400 TO 404}
  bytes:{0 TO 64]
  http_response_code:[0 TO 64}

You can also do searches with one side unbounded::

  http_response_code:>400
  http_response_code:<400
  http_response_code:>=400
  http_response_code:<=400

It is also possible to combine unbounded range operators::

  http_response_code:(>=400 AND <500)

Escaping
^^^^^^^^

The following characters must be escaped with a backslash::

  && || : \ / + - ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ?

Example::

  resource:\/posts\/45326

Time frame selector
===================

The time frame selector defines in what time range to search in. It offers three different ways of selecting a time range and
is vital for search speed: If you know you are only interested in messages of the last hour, only search in that time frame.
This will make Graylog search in relevant indices only and greatly reduce system load and required resources. You can read
more about this here: :doc:`index_model`

Relative time frame selector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The relative time frame selector lets you look for messages from the selected option to the time you hit the search button. The selector
offers a wide set of relative time frames that fit most of your search needs.

Absolute time frame selector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When you know exactly the boundaries of your search, you want to use the absolute time frame selector. Simply introduce the dates and
times for the search manually or click in the input field to open up a calendar where you can choose the day with your mouse.

Keyword time frame selector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Graylog offers a keyword time frame selector that allows you to specify the time frame for the search in natural language like *last hour* or *last 90 days*. The web interface shows a preview of the two actual timestamps that will be used for the search.

.. image:: /images/queries_keyword_time_selector.png

Here are a few examples for possible values.

* "last month" searches between one month ago and now
* "4 hours ago" searches between four hours ago and now
* "1st of april to 2 days ago" searches between 1st of April and 2 days ago
* "yesterday midnight +0200 to today midnight +0200" searches between yesterday midnight and today midnight in timezone +0200 - will be 22:00 in UTC

The time frame is parsed using the `natty natural language parser <http://natty.joestelmach.com/>`_. Please consult its documentation for details.

Saved searches
==============
Sometimes you may want to search a specific search configuration to be used later. Graylog provides a saved search functionality
to accomplish exactly that.

Once you submitted your search, selected the fields you want to show from the search sidebar, and chosen a resolution for the histogram, click on
the *Save search criteria* button on the sidebar.

.. image:: /images/saved_search_create.png

Give a name to the current search and click on save. When you want to use the saved search later on, you only need to select it from the saved search
selector.

.. image:: /images/saved_search_selector.png

Of course, you can always update the selected fields or name of your saved search. To do so, select the saved search from the saved search selector,
update the field selection or histogram resolution, and click on *Saved search* -> *Update search criteria*. It is also possible to delete the saved
search by selecting *Saved search* -> *Delete saved search*.

Analysis
========
Graylog provides several tools to analyze your search results. It is possible to save these analysis into dashboards, so you can check them over
time in a more convenient way. To analyze a field from your search results, expand the field in the search sidebar and click on the button of the
analysis you want to perform.

.. _field_statistics:

Field statistics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Compute different statistics on your fields, to help you better summarize and understand the data in them.

The statistical information consist of: total, mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, variance, sum, and cardinality. On non-numeric fields,
you can only see the total amount of messages containing that field, and the cardinality of the field, i.e. the number of unique values it has.

.. image:: /images/field_statistics.png


.. _quick_values:

Quick values
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Quick values helps you to find out the distribution of values for a field. Alongside a graphic representation of the common values contained
in a field, Graylog will display a table with all different values, allowing you to see the number of times they appear. You can include any value
in your search query by clicking on the magnifying glass icon located in the value row.

.. image:: /images/quick_values.png


.. _field_graphs:

Field graphs
^^^^^^^^^^^^
You can create field graphs for any numeric field, by clicking on the *Generate chart* button in the search sidebar. Using the options in the
*Customize* menu on top of the field graph, you can change the statistical function used in the graph, the kind of graph to use to represent
the values, the graph interpolation, as well as the time resolution.

.. image:: /images/field_graph.png

Once you have customized some field graphs, you can also combine them by dragging them from the hamburger icon on the top corner of the graph,
and dropping them into another field graph. You can see the location of the hamburger icon and the end result in the the following
screenshots:

.. image:: /images/stacked_graph_1.png
.. image:: /images/stacked_graph_2.png

Field graphs appear every time you perform a search, allowing you to compare data, or combine graphs coming from different streams.

Export results as CSV
=====================
It is also possible to export the results of your search as a CSV document. To do so, select all fields you want to export in the search
sidebar, click on the *More actions* button, and select *Export as CSV*.

.. image:: /images/export_as_csv.png

**Hint**: Some Graylog inputs keep the original message in the the `full_message` field. If you need to export the original message, you
can do so by clicking on the *List all fields* link at the bottom of the sidebar, and then selecting the `full_message` field.

Search result highlighting
==========================

Graylog supports search result highlighting since v0.20.2:

Enabling/Disabling search result highlighting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using search result highlighting will result in slightly higher resource consumption of searches. You can enable and disable
it using a configuration parameter in the ``graylog.conf`` of your ``graylog-server`` nodes::

    allow_highlighting = true
