Basic configuration
-------------------

We are shipping the ``graylog-ctl`` tool with the virtual machine appliances to get you started
with a customised setup as quickly as possible. Run these (optional) commands to configure the
most basic settings of Graylog in the appliance::

  sudo graylog-ctl set-email-config <smtp server> [--port=<smtp port> --user=<username> --password=<password>]
  sudo graylog-ctl set-admin-password <password>
  sudo graylog-ctl set-timezone <zone acronym>
  sudo graylog-ctl reconfigure

The ``graylog-ctl`` has much more functionality and is documented :ref:`here <graylog-ctl>`.
We strongly recommend to learn more about it to ensure smooth operation of your virtual appliance.
