Operating System Packages
*************************

Until configuration management systems made their way into broader markets and many datacenters, one of the most common ways to install
software on Linux servers was to use operating system packages. Debian has ``DEB``, Red Hat has ``RPM`` and many other distributions are
based on those or come with own package formats. Online repositories of software packages and corresponding package managers make installing
and configuring new software a matter of a single command and a few minutes of time.

Graylog offers official ``DEB`` and ``RPM`` package repositories for the following operating systems.

* Ubuntu 12.04, 14.04
* Debian 7, 8
* RHEL/CentOS 6, 7

The repositories can be setup by installing a single package. Once that's done the Graylog packages can be installed via ``apt-get`` or
``yum``. The packages can also be downloaded with a web browser at https://packages.graylog2.org/ if needed.

**Make sure to install and configure Java (>= 7), MongoDB and Elasticsearch 1.7 before starting the Graylog services.**
