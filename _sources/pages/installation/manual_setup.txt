Graylog server on Linux
=======================

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You will need to have the following services installed on either the host you are running ``graylog-server`` on or on dedicated machines:

* `Elasticsearch 1.7 or later <https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch>`_ (Elasticsearch 2.x is currently not supported)
* MongoDB (as recent stable version as possible, **at least v2.0**)

Most standard MongoDB packages of Linux distributions are outdated. Use the `official MongoDB APT repository <http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-debian/>`_
(available for many distributions and operating systems)

You also **must** install **Java 7** or higher! Java 6 is not compatible with Graylog and will also not receive any more publicly available bug and security
fixes by Oracle.

A more detailed guide for installing the dependencies will follow. **The only important thing for Elasticsearch is that you set
the exactly same cluster name (e. g. ``cluster.name: graylog``) that is being used by Graylog in the Elasticsearch configuration (``conf/elasticsearch.yml``)**.

Downloading and extracting the server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Download the tar archive from the `download pages <https://www.graylog.org/download/>`_ and extract it on your system::

  ~$ tar xvfz graylog-VERSION.tgz
  ~$ cd graylog-VERSION

Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now copy the example configuration file::

  ~# cp graylog.conf.example /etc/graylog/server/server.conf

You can leave most variables as they are for a first start. All of them should be well documented.

Configure at least the following variables in ``/etc/graylog/server/server.conf``:

 * ``is_master = true``
    * Set only one ``graylog-server`` node as the master. This node will perform periodical and maintenance actions that slave nodes won't.
      Every slave node will accept messages just as the master nodes. Nodes will fall back to slave mode if there already is a master in the
      cluster.
 * ``password_secret``
    * You must set a secret that is used for password encryption and salting here. The server will refuse to start if it's not set. Generate
      a secret with for example ``pwgen -N 1 -s 96``.  If you run multiple ``graylog-server`` nodes, make sure you use the same
      ``password_secret`` for all of them!
 * ``root_password_sha2``
    * A SHA2 hash of a password you will use for your initial login. Set this to a SHA2 hash generated with ``echo -n yourpassword | shasum -a 256``
      and you will be able to log in to the web interface with username *admin* and password *yourpassword*.
 * ``elasticsearch_max_docs_per_index = 20000000``
    * How many log messages to keep per index. This setting multiplied with ``elasticsearch_max_number_of_indices`` results in the maximum number of
      messages in your Graylog setup. It is always better to have several more smaller indices than just a few larger ones.
 * ``elasticsearch_max_number_of_indices = 20``
    * How many indices to have in total. If this number is reached, the oldest index will be deleted. **Also take a look at the other retention
      strategies that allow you to automatically delete messages based on their age.**
 * ``elasticsearch_shards = 4``
    * The number of shards for your indices. A good setting here highly depends on the number of nodes in your Elasticsearch cluster. If you have
      one node, set it to ``1``.
 * ``elasticsearch_replicas = 0``
     * The number of replicas for your indices. A good setting here highly depends on the number of nodes in your Elasticsearch cluster. If you
       have one node, set it to ``0``.
 * ``mongodb_*``
    * Enter your MongoDB connection and authentication information here. Make sure that you connect the web interface to the same database.
      You don't need to configure ``mongodb_user`` and ``mongodb_password`` if ``mongodb_useauth`` is set to ``false``.

Starting the server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You need to have Java installed. Running the OpenJDK is totally fine and should be available on all platforms. For example on Debian it is::

  ~$ apt-get install openjdk-7-jre

**You need at least Java 7** as Java 6 has reached EOL.

Start the server::

  ~$ cd bin/
  ~$ ./graylogctl start

The server will try to write a ``node_id`` to the ``graylog-server-node-id`` file. It won't start if it can't write there because of for
example missing permissions.

See the startup parameters description below to learn more about available startup parameters. Note that you might have to be `root`
to bind to the popular port 514 for syslog inputs.

You should see a line like this in the debug output of ``graylog-server`` successfully connected to your Elasticsearch cluster::

  2013-10-01 12:13:22,382 DEBUG: org.elasticsearch.transport.netty - [graylog-server] connected to node [[Unuscione, Angelo][thN_gIBkQDm2ab7k-2Zaaw][inet[/10.37.160.227:9300]]]

You can find the ``graylog-server`` logs in the directory ``logs/``.

**Important:** All ``graylog-server`` instances must have synchronised time. We strongly recommend to use
`NTP <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol>`_ or similar mechanisms on all machines of your Graylog infrastructure.

Supplying external logging configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``graylog-server`` uses Log4j for its internal logging and ships with a
`default log configuration file <https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-server/blob/1.2/graylog2-bootstrap/src/main/resources/log4j.xml>`_
which is embedded within the shipped JAR.

In case you need to overwrite the configuration ``graylog-server`` uses, you can supply a Java system property specifying the path to
the configuration file in your ``graylogctl`` script. Append this before the `-jar` paramter::

  -Dlog4j.configuration=file:///tmp/logj4.xml

Substitute the actual path to the file for the ``/tmp/log4j.xml`` in the example.

In case you do not have a log rotation system already in place, you can also configure Graylog to rotate logs based on their size to prevent its
logs to grow without bounds.

One such example ``log4j.xml`` configuration is shown below. Graylog includes the ``log4j-extras`` companion classes to support time based and size
based log rotation. This is the example::

  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <!DOCTYPE log4j:configuration PUBLIC "-//APACHE//DTD LOG4J 1.2//EN" "log4j.dtd">
  <log4j:configuration xmlns:log4j="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/">

      <appender name="FILE" class="org.apache.log4j.rolling.RollingFileAppender">
          <rollingPolicy class="org.apache.log4j.rolling.FixedWindowRollingPolicy" >
              <param name="activeFileName" value="/tmp/server.log" /> <!-- ADAPT -->
              <param name="fileNamePattern" value="/tmp/server.%i.log" /> <!-- ADAPT -->
              <param name="minIndex" value="1" /> <!-- ADAPT -->
              <param name="maxIndex" value="10" /> <!-- ADAPT -->
          </rollingPolicy>
          <triggeringPolicy class="org.apache.log4j.rolling.SizeBasedTriggeringPolicy">
              <param name="maxFileSize" value="5767168" /> <!-- ADAPT: For example 5.5MB in bytes -->
          </triggeringPolicy>
          <layout class="org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout">
              <param name="ConversionPattern" value="%d %-5p: %c - %m%n"/>
          </layout>
      </appender>

      <!-- Application Loggers -->
      <logger name="org.graylog2">
          <level value="info"/>
      </logger>
      <!-- this emits a harmless warning for ActiveDirectory every time which we can't work around :( -->
      <logger name="org.apache.directory.api.ldap.model.message.BindRequestImpl">
          <level value="error"/>
      </logger>
      <!-- Root Logger -->
      <root>
          <priority value="info"/>
          <appender-ref ref="FILE"/>
      </root>

  </log4j:configuration>

Command line (CLI) parameters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are a number of CLI parameters you can pass to the call in your ``graylogctl`` script:

* ``-h``, ``--help``: Show help message
* ``-f CONFIGFILE``, ``--configfile CONFIGFILE``: Use configuration file `CONFIGFILE` for Graylog; default: ``/etc/graylog/server/server.conf``
* ``-t``, ``--configtest``: Validate the Graylog configuration and exit with exit code 0 if the configuration file is syntactically correct, exit code 1 and a description of the error otherwise
* ``-d``, ``--debug``: Run in debug mode
* ``-l``, ``--local``: Run in local mode. Automatically invoked if in debug mode. Will not send system statistics, even if enabled and allowed. Only interesting for development and testing purposes.
* ``-s``, ``--statistics``: Print utilization statistics to STDOUT
* ``-r``, ``--no-retention``: Do not automatically delete old/outdated indices
* ``-p PIDFILE``, ``--pidfile PIDFILE``: Set the file containing the PID of graylog to `PIDFILE`; default: `/tmp/graylog.pid`
* ``-np``, ``--no-pid-file``: Do not write PID file (overrides `-p`/`--pidfile`)
* ``--version``: Show version of Graylog and exit

Problems with IPv6 vs. IPv4?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If your `graylog-server` instance refuses to listen on IPv4 addresses and always chooses for example a `rest_listen_address` like `:::12900`
you can tell the JVM to prefer the IPv4 stack.

Add the `java.net.preferIPv4Stack` flag in your `graylogctl` script or from wherever you are calling the `graylog.jar`::

    ~$ sudo -u graylog java -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -jar graylog.jar

Graylog web interface on Linux
==============================

Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The only thing you need is at least one compatible ``graylog-server`` node. Please use the same version number to make sure that it
is compatible.

You also **must** use **Java 7**! Java 6 is not compatible with Graylog and will also not receive any more publicly available bug
and security fixes by Oracle.

Downloading and extracting the web-interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Download the package from the `download pages <https://www.graylog.org/download/>`_.

Extract the archive::

  ~$ tar xvfz graylog-web-interface-VERSION.tgz
  ~$ cd graylog-web-interface-VERSION

Configuring the web interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open ``conf/graylog-web-interface.conf`` and set the two following variables:

* ``graylog2-server.uris="http://127.0.0.1:12900/"``: This is the list of ``graylog-server`` nodes the web interface will try to use.
  You can configure one or multiple, separated by commas. Use the ``rest_listen_uri`` (configured in ``graylog.conf``) of your ``graylog-server`` instances here.

* ``application.secret=""``: A secret for encryption. Use a long, randomly generated string here. (for example generated using ``pwgen -N 1 -s 96``)

Starting the web interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You need to have Java installed. Running the OpenJDK is totally fine and should be available on all platforms. For example on Debian it is::

  ~$ apt-get install openjdk-7-jre

**You need at least Java 7** as Java 6 has reached EOL.

Now start the web interface::

  ~$ bin/graylog-web-interface
  Play server process ID is 5723
  [info] play - Application started (Prod)
  [info] play - Listening for HTTP on /0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:9000

The web interface will listen on port 9000. You should see a login screen right away after pointing your browser to it. Log in with username
``admin`` and the password you configured at ``root_password_sha2`` in the ``graylog.conf`` of your ``graylog-server``.

Changing the listen port and address works like this::

  ~$ bin/graylog-web-interface -Dhttp.port=1234 -Dhttp.address=127.0.0.1

Java generally prefers to bind to an IPv6 address if that is supported by your system, while you might want to prefer IPv4. To change Java's
default preference you can pass ``-Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true`` to the startup script::

  ~$ bin/graylog-web-interface -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true

All those ``-D`` settings can also be added to the ``JAVA_OPTS`` environment variable which is being read by the startup script, too.

You can start the web interface in background for example like this::

  ~$ nohup bin/graylog-web-interface &

Custom configuration file path
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can put the configuration file into another directory like this:

  ~$ bin/graylog-web-interface -Dconfig.file=/etc/graylog-web-interface.conf

Create a message input and send a first message
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Log in to the web interface and navigate to *System* -> *Nodes*. Select your ``graylog-server`` node there and click on *Manage inputs*.

.. image:: /images/create_input.png

Launch a new *Raw/Plaintext UDP* input, listening on port ``9099`` and listening on ``127.0.0.1``. No need to configure anything else for now.
The list of running inputs on that node should show you your new input right away. Let's send a message in::

  echo "Hello Graylog, let's be friends." | nc -w 1 -u 127.0.0.1 9099

This has sent a short string to the raw UDP input you just opened. Now search for *friends* using the searchbar on the top and you should already
see the message you just sent in. Click on it in the table and see it in detail:

.. image:: /images/setup_1.png

You have just sent your first message to Graylog! Why not spawn a syslog input and point some of your servers to it? You could also create some user
accounts for your colleagues.

HTTPS
^^^^^

Enabling HTTPS is easy. Just start the web interface like this::

  bin/graylog-web-interface -Dhttps.port=443

This will generate self-signed certificate. To use proper certificates you must configure a Java key store. Most signing authorities provide
instructions on how to create a Java keystore and the official keystore utility docs can be found
`here <http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/solaris/keytool.html>`_.

  * ``https.keyStore`` The path to the keystore containing the private key and certificate, if not provided generates a keystore for you
  * ``https.keyStoreType`` The key store type, defaults to JKS
  * ``https.keyStorePassword`` The password, defaults to a blank password
  * ``https.keyStoreAlgorithm`` The key store algorithm, defaults to the platforms default algorithm

To disable HTTP without SSL completely and enforce HTTPS, use this parameter::

  -Dhttp.port=disabled

Configuring logging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The default setting of the web interface is to write its own logs to ``STDOUT``. You can take control of the logging by specifying an own
`Logback <http://logback.qos.ch/>`_ configuration file to use::

  bin/graylog-web-interface -Dlogger.file=/etc/graylog-web-interface-log.xml

This is an example Logback configuration file that has a disabled ``STDOUT`` appender and an enabled appender that writes to a file
(``/var/log/graylog/web/graylog-web-interface.log``), keeps 30 days of logs in total and creates a new log file if a file should have
reached a size of 100MB::

  <configuration>

      <!--
      <appender name="STDOUT" class="ch.qos.logback.core.ConsoleAppender">
          <encoder>
              <pattern>%date %-5level [%thread] - [%logger]- %msg%n</pattern>
          </encoder>
      </appender>
      -->

      <appender name="ROLLING_FILE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.RollingFileAppender">
          <file>/var/log/graylog/web/graylog-web-interface.log</file>
          <rollingPolicy class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.TimeBasedRollingPolicy">
              <FileNamePattern>/var/log/graylog/web/graylog-web-interface.log.%d{yyyy-MM-dd}.%i.log.gz</FileNamePattern>
              <MaxHistory>30</MaxHistory>
              <timeBasedFileNamingAndTriggeringPolicy class="ch.qos.logback.core.rolling.SizeAndTimeBasedFNATP">
                  <maxFileSize>100MB</maxFileSize>
              </timeBasedFileNamingAndTriggeringPolicy>
          </rollingPolicy>
          <encoder class="ch.qos.logback.classic.encoder.PatternLayoutEncoder">
              <pattern>%date [%thread] %-5level %logger{36} - %msg%n</pattern>
          </encoder>
      </appender>

      <root level="INFO">
          <!--<appender-ref ref="STDOUT" />-->
          <appender-ref ref="ROLLING_FILE" />
      </root>

  </configuration>
